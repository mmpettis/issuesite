        <p>Recent studies show the severity of teen mental health concerns are rising across the county.The <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/data.html"/a>CDC</a>reports that:<br>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A combined 20 million children between the ages of 3 and 17 were diagnosed with either ADHD, anxiety, depression, or a behavioral disorder between 2016 and 2019.</li>
                <li>Among teens, over 15% had a major depressive episode, with 36.7% reporting persistent feelings of sadness.</li>
                <li>4% of teens had a substance use disorder.</li>
                <li>Near 19% of teens reported seriously considering a suicide attempt.</li>
                <li>over 20% of children with depression did not receive any treatment, and over 40% of children with anxiety received no treatment.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    <p> A poll conducted by Ipos on behalf of <a href="https://www.nami.org/Support-Education/Publications-Reports/Survey-Reports/Poll-of-Teen-Mental-Health-from-Teens-Themselves-(2022)"/a>NAMI</a> found that teens are comfortable discussing mental health and the way it affects them.</p>
   
    <p>Key Findings:<br>
        <ul>
    <li>64% feel the world is more stressful now than when parents were their age</li>
    <li>2 in 3 students agree schools should teach about what mental health is, including where and how to seek treatment</li>
    <li>4 in 5 who seek mental health information from teachers say they trust their teachers and other adults at their school to provide it</li>
    <li>67% think schools should offer days off for mental health</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
<p>Overall, teens don't think their schools are doing enough.</p>
